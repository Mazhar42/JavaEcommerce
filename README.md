# JavaEcommerce

**JavaEcommerce** is an ecommerce application where user can see the products and add products to the cart. Then the total cart item will be changed dynamically. If the user click at the Cart then the checkout page will be served where the products items been added to the cart being shown and the total price of the products been calculated and shown there. 

There will be two pages one is the product list page where products are shown in a table with barebone css. The key thing of this project is the functionality being implemented properly. Thats why the design has been overlooked here.
